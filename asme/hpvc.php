		<p>  ASME-NITP registered its strong presence with its scintillating performance in the ASME Human Powered Vehicle Challenge India-2014 held from 16-18 January 2015 at Delhi Technological University. The team had a total of 16 members.</p>

		<p>The team performed exceptionally well leaving behind prestigious institutes like IIT Bombay, IIT Patna, NIT Jalandhar, NIT Rourkela, BITS Pilani. The participation of the team was completely sponsored by the institute. The whole project was carried out under the guidance of Prof. Prakash Chandra, the Faculty Advisor of ASME-NIT Patna. The designing of the vehicle �VELOCITY 2.0� took two months whereas the fabrication took about a month. The vehicle was designed to achieve very high speed at maximum comfort for the driver. Transmission system was made innovative by using double chain system. </p>

The designing of the vehicle �VELOCITY� took two months whereas the fabrication took about a month. The vehicle was designed to achieve very high speed at maximum comfort for the driver. Aerodynamic features and aesthetics were given due consideration as well during the designing phase. There was a very innovative �Landing gear system� that was employed in the vehicle so as to ensure complete safety of the driver whenever the vehicle is out of balance.  </p>
