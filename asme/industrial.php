			An educational visit was held by the society to Sudha Dairy Production Facility, Anisabad in the month of September. The visiting group consisted of about 30 members, all of them being 2nd year students of Mechanical Engineering. The students learned how different concepts of Mechanical Engineering are applied in manufacturing of milk based products. The management of the dairy project had provided two instructors to demonstrate the working of the machineries in the production unit to the students. The tour ended with refreshments provided to the students courtesy of the Sudha Dairy Management.
