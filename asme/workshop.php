		<p>A twenty-day workshop on designing tool PRO-E was conducted at NIT Patna by ASME Student Section in April 2013 held in association with CADD-Centre Patna. The workshop was attended by thirty eight students and was a huge success. The fees was subsidized for the member students and classes were conducted in the campus itself which made it a lot more convenient for the students. "Computer Aided Designing and Manufacturing forms an integral part of our curriculum. Getting a first hand experience in the subject was very beneficial. I thank the ASME Team for conducting this workshop." said Murari Kumar, a third year student of Mechanical Engineering. </p>
